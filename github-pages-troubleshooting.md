# GitHub Pages Deployment Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with GitHub Pages deployment, here are some common solutions:

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Pages not building**
   - Check the GitHub Actions tab to see if the workflow is running
   - Verify that the workflow file (.github/workflows/github-pages.yml) is correctly formatted
   - Make sure the repository settings have GitHub Pages enabled and pointing to GitHub Actions

2. **CSS or JavaScript not loading**
   - Check for any path issues in your HTML files
   - Make sure all links use relative paths
   - Verify that no resources are being loaded over http:// (use https:// or protocol-relative URLs)

3. **Custom domain not working**
   - Verify the CNAME file contains your domain name
   - Check DNS settings with your domain provider
   - Ensure SSL is properly configured

4. **Slow deployment**
   - GitHub Pages deployments can sometimes take 5-10 minutes
   - Check the Actions tab for current status

## Manual Deployment Steps

If automatic deployment fails, you can try:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to Settings > Pages
3. Select "GitHub Actions" as the source
4. Manually trigger the workflow from the Actions tab
